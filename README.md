Merk Media Car Event Promotional Page

https://phantom82aj.github.io/milestone/

The site displays past and future event information, locations, visual images, video flyer, and a way for others to contact the promter on any upcoming collaborations.
The site is also used to promte our services including: providing models, photographers, video, editing, vendors, locations, permits needed, promoting, everything needed to host a successful car show. 
The car scene has long needed a One-Stop-Shop place for enthusiasts and car show hosts to go to obtain services in order to showcase an event. This website is that exact location to find all the services needed to put on a successful event.

Using the resume template as an outline I was able to create a form of a resume in a sense for a fellow car enthusiast in the form of a car event promotional page to illustrate and showcase the services offered to the car scene. 
I included a home page with personalized logo and title (changed font and sizing), included a list, and modified fonts, sizes, and information.
I included a past events and gallery which was created by me which showcases the past events for future potential client. I modified fonts, colors, sizing, and information. 
I modified the contact page which will be very important for collaborations with other car enthusiasts looking to host events and employ our services. 
I modified the pdf page to be a video flyer instead of the next upcoming event that we are hosting.
I modified the information on the footer to be relevant to the project as a whole. 

On the home page users can obtain information about the services we offer as well as general information about upcoming events (location, time, date, contact number, etc)
On the Gallery page there are visual images from the past 2 events that were held
On the contact page is has a way for potential clients to contact us directly for pricing and details. Each user must put their name, email, and give a brief description of the services they need.
The download flyer page is so that users can see the next event that is upcoming in the form of a video.

Screen shots were taken to prove functionality of each individual page and that all links were working correctly.

The next features to implement would be the back end structure which links users to social media accounts in the footer
Also when they submit an inquiry on a collaboration it will link directly to the promoter's business email account.
Pricing features will also be added in to give potential clients the an estimated of service prices.

The programming used to create this website was: html, css, bootstrap, google fonts
The program that I used to assit was the layout from the resume project provided by Code Institute.
Using their layout as a foundation I was able to modify and customize the site to tailor to the needs of a car event promoter.
As a whole this project allows its visitors to see the services offered from a car event promoter.

The entire site was tested for errors or bugs including: functionality, visual displays, grammar, punctuation, mobile design, tablet design, and desktop design.

The project is hosted on Github with an address of https://phantom82aj.github.io/milestone/
